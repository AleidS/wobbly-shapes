Hello!

With this javascript file you can create complex curved shapes from multiple divs, with inverted borders;

![1717620445639](image/readMe/1717620445639.png)

simply place your shapes in a div with classname 'roundedContainer' and relative or absolute positioning:

![1717620509852](image/readMe/1717620509852.png)

it will create an svg clip-path around your parent div, retaining it's background color/image. It should also implement its border radius around all the corners of the clipping path.

Please note:

shapes should be adjacent, not overlapping.

if you use borders on the inner divs,

add;

   box-sizing: border-box;

    -moz-box-sizing: border-box;

    -webkit-box-sizing: border-box;
